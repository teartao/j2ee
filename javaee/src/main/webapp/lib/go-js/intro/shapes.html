<h2>Shapes</h2>
<p>
Use the <a>Shape</a> class to paint a geometrical figure.
You can control what kind of shape is drawn and how it is stroked and filled.
</p>

<h3>Figures</h3>
<p>
You can set the <a>Shape.figure</a> property to commonly named kinds of shapes.
When using <a>GraphObject.make</a>, you can pass the figure name as a string argument.
You may also need to set the <a>GraphObject.desiredSize</a> or <a>GraphObject.width</a> and <a>GraphObject.height</a> properties,
although it is also common to have the size determined by the Panel that the shape is in.
</p>
<p>
In these simplistic demonstrations, the code programmatically creates a Part and adds it to the Diagram.
Once you learn about models and data binding you will generally not create parts (nodes or links) programmatically.
</p>
<p>
Here are several of the most often used Shape figures:
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" id="figureShapes">
  diagram.add(
    $(go.Part, "Horizontal",
      $(go.Shape, "Rectangle",
                  { width: 40, height: 60, margin: 4, fill: null }),
      $(go.Shape, "RoundedRectangle",
                  { width: 40, height: 60, margin: 4, fill: null }),
      $(go.Shape, "Ellipse",
                  { width: 40, height: 60, margin: 4, fill: null }),
      $(go.Shape, "Triangle",
                  { width: 40, height: 60, margin: 4, fill: null }),
      $(go.Shape, "Diamond",
                  { width: 40, height: 60, margin: 4, fill: null })
    ));
</pre>
<script>goCode("figureShapes", 600, 100)</script>
<p>
You can see all of the named geometrical figures in the
<a href="../samples/shapes.html" target="samples">shapes</a> sample.
</p>

<h3>Fill and Strokes</h3>
<p>
The <a>Shape.stroke</a> property specifies the brush used to draw the shape's outline.
The <a>Shape.fill</a> property specifies the brush used to fill the shape's outline.
Additional "stroke..." properties also control how the shape's outline is drawn.
The most common such property is <a>Shape.strokeWidth</a>.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" id="strokedShapes">
  diagram.add(
    $(go.Part, "Horizontal",
      $(go.Shape, { figure: "Club", width: 40, height: 40, margin: 4
                    }),  // default fill and stroke are "black"
      $(go.Shape, { figure: "Club", width: 40, height: 40, margin: 4,
                    fill: "green" }),
      $(go.Shape, { figure: "Club", width: 40, height: 40, margin: 4,
                    fill: "green", stroke: null }),
      $(go.Shape, { figure: "Club", width: 40, height: 40, margin: 4,
                    fill: null, stroke: "green" }),
      $(go.Shape, { figure: "Club", width: 40, height: 40, margin: 4,
                    fill: null, stroke: "green", strokeWidth: 3 }),
      $(go.Shape, { figure: "Club", width: 40, height: 40, margin: 4,
                    fill: null, stroke: "green", strokeWidth: 6 }),
      $(go.Shape, { figure: "Club", width: 40, height: 40, margin: 4,
                    fill: "green", background: "orange" })
    ));
</pre>
<script>goCode("strokedShapes", 600, 80)</script>

<p>
The <a>Shape.stroke</a> and <a>Shape.fill</a> properties take <a>Brush</a>es
but most often are given a CSS color string to denote solid color brushes.
These two properties default to a solid black brush.
However it is common to assign one of them to be either null or "transparent".
A null brush means that nothing is drawn for that stroke or fill.
A transparent brush produces the same appearance but different hit-testing behavior.
A shape with a null <a>Shape.fill</a> produces a "hollow" shape -- clicking inside
the shape will not "hit" that shape and thus not select the <a>Node</a> that that shape is in.
But a shape with a transparent fill produces a "filled" shape -- a mouse event inside the
shape will "hit" that shape.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" id="fill">
  diagram.add(
    $(go.Part, "Table",
      $(go.Shape, { row: 0, column: 0, figure: "Club", width: 40, height: 40, margin: 4,
                    fill: "green" }),
      $(go.TextBlock, "green", { row: 1, column: 0 }),
      $(go.Shape, { row: 0, column: 1, figure: "Club", width: 40, height: 40, margin: 4,
                    fill: "white" }),
      $(go.TextBlock, "white", { row: 1, column: 1 }),
      $(go.Shape, { row: 0, column: 2, figure: "Club", width: 40, height: 40, margin: 4,
                    fill: "transparent" }),
      $(go.TextBlock, "transparent", { row: 1, column: 2 }),
      $(go.Shape, { row: 0, column: 3, figure: "Club", width: 40, height: 40, margin: 4,
                    fill: null }),
      $(go.TextBlock, "null", { row: 1, column: 3 })
    ));
</pre>
<script>goCode("fill", 600, 80)</script>
<p>
Try clicking inside each of the shapes to see which ones will respond to the click and cause the whole panel to be selected.
Only the last one, with a null fill, is truly "hollow".
</p>

<h3>Geometry</h3>
<p>
Every <a>Shape</a> gets its "shape" from the <a>Geometry</a> that it uses.
A Geometry is just a saved description of how to draw some lines given a set of points.
Setting <a>Shape.figure</a> uses a named predefined geometry.
</p>
<p>
If you want something different from all of the predefined figures in <b>GoJS</b>,
you can construct your own Geometry and set <a>Shape.geometry</a>.
One way of building your own <a>Geometry</a> is by building <a>PathFigure</a>s
consisting of <a>PathSegment</a>s.  But an easier way to create geometries is by
calling <a>Geometry.parse</a> to read a string that has a geometry-defining path expression,
or to set <a>Shape.geometryString</a> to such a string.
These expressions have commands for moving an imaginary "pen".
The syntax for geometry paths is documented in the <a href="geometry.html">Geometry Path Strings</a> page.
</p>
<p>
This example creates a Geometry that looks like the letter "W"
and uses it in several Shape objects with different stroke characteristics.
Geometry objects may be shared by multiple Shapes.
Note that there may be no need to specify the <a>GraphObject.desiredSize</a> or <a>GraphObject.width</a> and <a>GraphObject.height</a>,
because the Geometry defines its own sizes.
If the size is set or imposed by the containing Panel, the effective geometry is determined by the <a>Shape.geometryStretch</a> property.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" id="geometries">
  var W_geometry = go.Geometry.parse("M 0,0 L 10,50 20,10 30,50 40,0", false);
  diagram.add(
    $(go.Part, "Horizontal",
      $(go.Shape, { geometry: W_geometry, strokeWidth: 2 }),
      $(go.Shape, { geometry: W_geometry, stroke: "blue", strokeWidth: 10,
                    strokeJoin: "miter", strokeCap: "butt" }),
      $(go.Shape, { geometry: W_geometry, stroke: "blue", strokeWidth: 10,
                    strokeJoin: "miter", strokeCap: "round" }),
      $(go.Shape, { geometry: W_geometry, stroke: "blue", strokeWidth: 10,
                    strokeJoin: "miter", strokeCap: "square" }),
      $(go.Shape, { geometry: W_geometry, stroke: "green", strokeWidth: 10,
                    strokeJoin: "bevel", strokeCap: "butt" }),
      $(go.Shape, { geometry: W_geometry, stroke: "green", strokeWidth: 10,
                    strokeJoin: "bevel", strokeCap: "round" }),
      $(go.Shape, { geometry: W_geometry, stroke: "green", strokeWidth: 10,
                    strokeJoin: "bevel", strokeCap: "square" }),
      $(go.Shape, { geometry: W_geometry, stroke: "red", strokeWidth: 10,
                    strokeJoin: "round", strokeCap: "butt" }),
      $(go.Shape, { geometry: W_geometry, stroke: "red", strokeWidth: 10,
                    strokeJoin: "round", strokeCap: "round" }),

                    strokeJoin: "round", strokeCap: "square" }),
      $(go.Shape, { geometry: W_geometry, stroke: "purple", strokeWidth: 2,
                    strokeDashArray: [4, 2] }),
      $(go.Shape, { geometry: W_geometry, stroke: "purple", strokeWidth: 2,
                    strokeDashArray: [6, 6, 2, 2] })
    ));
</pre>
<script>goCode("geometries", 600, 100)</script>

<h3>Angle and Scale</h3>
<p>
Besides setting the <a>GraphObject.desiredSize</a> or <a>GraphObject.width</a> and <a>GraphObject.height</a> to declare the size of a <a>Shape</a>,
you can also set other properties to affect the appearance.
For example, you can set the <a>GraphObject.angle</a> and <a>GraphObject.scale</a> properties.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" id="transformedShapes">
  diagram.add(
    $(go.Part, "Table",
      $(go.Shape, { row: 0, column: 1,
                    figure: "Club", fill: "green", width: 40, height: 40,
                    }),  // default angle is zero; default scale is one
      $(go.Shape, { row: 0, column: 2,
                    figure: "Club", fill: "green", width: 40, height: 40,
                    angle: 30 }),
      $(go.Shape, { row: 0, column: 3,
                    figure: "Club", fill: "green", width: 40, height: 40,
                    scale: 1.5 }),
      $(go.Shape, { row: 0, column: 4,
                    figure: "Club", fill: "green", width: 40, height: 40,
                    angle: 30, scale: 1.5 })
    ));
</pre>
<script>goCode("transformedShapes", 600, 100)</script>

<p>
The <a>Shape.fill</a> and <a>GraphObject.background</a> brushes scale and rotate along with the shape.
The <a>GraphObject.areaBackground</a> is drawn in the containing panel's coordinates,
so it is not affected by the object's scale or angle.
</p>
<p>
The following shapes each use three separate linear gradient brushes, one for each of the three properties.
Note the unrotated shape on the left.  Because its <a>GraphObject.background</a> brush is opaque,
you cannot see the <a>GraphObject.areaBackground</a> brush that fills the same area behind it.
</p>
