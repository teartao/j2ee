<h2>Building Parts with GraphObjects</h2>
<p>
You can construct a <a>Node</a> or other kind of <a>Part</a> in traditional JavaScript code.
<b>GoJS</b> also offers a more declarative-looking manner of building parts that has several advantages over code.
</p>
<p>
The following pages will discuss the basic kinds of objects you can use to build a node.
These pages build up a diagram by explicitly creating and adding nodes and links.
Later pages will show how to build diagrams using models rather than using such code.
</p>

<h3>Building with code</h3>
<p>
A <a>GraphObject</a> is a JavaScript object that can be constructed and initialized
in the same manner as any other object.
A <a>Node</a> is a <a>GraphObject</a> that contains <a>GraphObject</a>s such as <a>TextBlock</a>s, <a>Shape</a>s,
and <a>Panel</a>s that may contain yet more GraphObjects.
</p>
<p>
A very simple Node might consist of a Shape and a TextBlock.
You can build such a visual tree of GraphObjects using code such as:
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" id="simpleCode">
  var node = new go.Node(go.Panel.Auto);
  var shape = new go.Shape();
  shape.figure = "RoundedRectangle";
  shape.fill = "lightblue";
  node.add(shape);
  var textblock = new go.TextBlock();
  textblock.text = "Hello!";
  textblock.margin = 5;
  node.add(textblock);
  diagram.add(node);
</pre>
<p>
This code produces the following diagram.  It is a "live" diagram, not a screenshot image,
so you can click on the node to select it and then drag it around.
</p>
<script>goCode("simpleCode", 250, 150)</script>
<p>
Although building a node in this manner will work, as the nodes get more complicated
the code will become more complicated to read and to maintain.
Fortunately <b>GoJS</b> has a better way to make Parts out of GraphObjects.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, later sections will discuss how Nodes and Links should be created automatically using models and data-binding.
Until that time, these pages will create Nodes explicitly and add them to Diagrams directly.
</p>

<h3>Building with <b>GraphObject.make</b></h3>
<p>
<b>GoJS</b> defines a static function, <a>GraphObject.make</a>, that is very useful in
constructing GraphObjects without having to think of and keep track of temporary variable names.
This static function also supports building objects in a nested fashion,
where the indentation gives you a clue about depth in the visual tree,
unlike the simple linear code shown above.
</p>
<p>
<a>GraphObject.make</a> is a function whose first argument must be a class type,
typically a subclass of <a>GraphObject</a>.
</p>
<p>
Additional arguments to <a>GraphObject.make</a> may be of several types:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a plain JavaScript object with property/value pairs -- these property values are set on the object being constructed</li>
<li>a <a>GraphObject</a>, which is added as an element to the <a>Panel</a> that is being constructed</li>
<li>a <b>GoJS</b> enumerated value constant, which is used as the value of the unique property of the object being constructed that can accept such a value</li>
<li>a string, which sets the <a>TextBlock.text</a>, <a>Shape.figure</a>, <a>Picture.source</a>, or <a>Panel.type</a> property of the object that is being constructed</li>
<li>a <a>RowColumnDefinition</a>, for describing row or columns in Table <a>Panel</a>s</li>
<li>a JavaScript Array, holding arguments to <a>GraphObject.make</a>, useful when returning more than one argument from a function</li>
<li>other specialized objects that are used in the appropriate manner for the object being constructed</li>
</ul>
<p>
We can rewrite the code above with <b>go.GraphObject.make</b> to produce exactly the same results:
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" id="simpleJSAML">
  var $ = go.GraphObject.make;
  diagram.add(
    $(go.Node, go.Panel.Auto,
      $(go.Shape,
        { figure: "RoundedRectangle",
          fill: "lightblue" }),
      $(go.TextBlock,
        { text: "Hello!",
          margin: 5 })
    ));
</pre>
<script>goCode("simpleJSAML", 250, 150)</script>
<p>
This can be simplified a bit by using string arguments:
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" id="simpleJSAML2">
  var $ = go.GraphObject.make;
  diagram.add(
    $(go.Node, "Auto",
      $(go.Shape, "RoundedRectangle", { fill: "lightblue" }),
      $(go.TextBlock, "Hello!", { margin: 5 })
    ));
</pre>
<script>goCode("simpleJSAML2", 250, 150)</script>
<p>
The use of <b>$</b> as an abbreviation for <b>go.GraphObject.make</b> is so handy
that we will assume its use from now on.
Having the call to <b>go.GraphObject.make</b> be minimized into a single character
helps remove clutter from the code and lets the indentation match the nesting of
<a>GraphObject</a>s in the visual tree that is being constructed.
</p>
<p>
Some other JavaScript libraries automatically define "$" to be a handy-to-type function name,
assuming that they are the only library that matters.
But you cannot have the same symbol have two different meanings at the same time in the same scope, of course.
So you may want to choose to use a different short name, such as "$$" or "GO" when using <b>GoJS</b>.
The <b>GoJS</b> documentation and samples make use of "$" because it makes the resulting code most clear.
</p>
<p class="box">
Another advantage of using <a>GraphObject.make</a> is that it will make sure that any
properties that you set are defined properties on the class.
If you have a typo in the name of the property, it will throw an error, for which you can see a message in the console log.
</p>
<p>
<a>GraphObject.make</a> also works to build <b>GoJS</b> classes other than ones inheriting from <a>GraphObject</a>.
Here is an example of using <b>go.GraphObject.make</b> to build a <a>Brush</a>
rather than a <a>GraphObject</a> subclass.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" id="gradientJSAML">
  diagram.add(
    $(go.Node, "Auto",
      $(go.Shape, "RoundedRectangle",
        { fill: $(go.Brush, go.Brush.Linear,
                  { 0.0: "Violet", 1.0: "Lavender" }) }),
      $(go.TextBlock, "Hello!",
        { margin: 5 })
    ));
</pre>
<script>goCode("gradientJSAML", 250, 150)</script>
<p>
Notice also how we set the <a>Shape.figure</a> and <a>TextBlock.text</a> by just using the string value.
</p>
<p>
It is also common to use <a>GraphObject.make</a> to build a <a>Diagram</a>.
In such a use a string argument, which must be the second argument, will name the DIV HTML element that the Diagram should use.
Equivalently you can pass a direct reference to the DIV element as the second argument.
</p>
<p>
Also, when setting properties on a Diagram, you can use property names that are strings consisting of two identifiers separated by a period.
The name before the period is used as the name of a property on the Diagram or on the <a>Diagram.toolManager</a> that returns an object whose property is to be set.
The name after the period is the name of the property that is set.
Note that because there is an embedded period, JavaScript property syntax requires that you use quotes.
</p>
<p>
You can also declare <a>DiagramEvent</a> listeners, as if calling <a>Diagram.addDiagramListener</a>,
by pretending to set a Diagram property that is actually the name of a DiagramEvent.
Because all known DiagramEvents have names that are capitalized, the names will not conflict with any Diagram property names.
</p>
<p>
Here is a moderately extensive usage of GraphObject.make to build a Diagram:
</p>
<pre>
  var myDiagram =
    $(go.Diagram, "myDiagramDiv",  // must name or refer to the DIV HTML element
      {
        // any initial diagram is centered in the viewport
        initialContentAlignment: go.Spot.Center,

        // don't initialize some properties until after a new model has been loaded
        "InitialLayoutCompleted": loadDiagramProperties,  // this DiagramEvent listener is defined below

        // have mouse wheel events zoom in and out instead of scroll up and down
        "toolManager.mouseWheelBehavior": go.ToolManager.WheelZoom,

        // specify a data object to copy for each new Node that is created by clicking
        "clickCreatingTool.archetypeNodeData": { text: "new node" }
      });

  function loadDiagramProperties(e) { . . . }
</pre>

<p>
All of this initialization is still JavaScript code, so we can call functions
and easily share objects such as brushes:
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" id="codeJSAML">
  var violetbrush = $(go.Brush, go.Brush.Linear, { 0.0: "Violet", 1.0: "Lavender" });

  diagram.add(
    $(go.Node, "Auto",
      $(go.Shape, "RoundedRectangle",
        { fill: violetbrush }),
      $(go.TextBlock, "Hello!",
        { margin: 5 })
    ));

  diagram.add(
    $(go.Node, "Auto",
      $(go.Shape, "Ellipse",
        { fill: violetbrush }),
      $(go.TextBlock, "Goodbye!",
        { margin: 5 })
    ));
</pre>
<script>goCode("codeJSAML", 250, 150)</script>
<p>
<a>Brush</a>es and <a>Geometry</a> objects may be shared, but <a>GraphObject</a>s may not be shared.
</p>

<p>
The following pages will provide more details about the basic building block classes,
<a>TextBlock</a>, <a>Shape</a>, and <a>Picture</a>, and about ways of aggregating them with the <a>Panel</a> class.
