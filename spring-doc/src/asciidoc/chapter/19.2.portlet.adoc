| Expression| Explanation

| handler mapping(s)
| (<<portlet-handlermapping>>) a list of pre- and post-processors and controllers that
  will be executed if they match certain criteria (for instance a matching portlet mode
  specified with the controller)

| controller(s)
| (<<portlet-controller>>) the beans providing the actual functionality (or at least,
  access to the functionality) as part of the MVC triad

| view resolver
| (<<portlet-viewresolver>>) capable of resolving view names to view definitions

| multipart resolver
| (<<portlet-multipart>>) offers functionality to process file uploads from HTML forms

| handler exception resolver
| (<<portlet-exceptionresolver>>) offers functionality to map exceptions to views or
  implement other more complex exception handling code

When a `DispatcherPortlet` is setup for use and a request comes in for that specific
`DispatcherPortlet`, it starts processing the request. The list below describes the
complete process a request goes through if handled by a `DispatcherPortlet`:

. The locale returned by `PortletRequest.getLocale()` is bound to the request to let
elements in the process resolve the locale to use when processing the request (rendering
the view, preparing data, etc.).
. If a multipart resolver is specified and this is an `ActionRequest`, the request is
inspected for multiparts and if they are found, it is wrapped in a
`MultipartActionRequest` for further processing by other elements in the process. (See
<<portlet-multipart>> for further information about multipart handling).
. An appropriate handler is searched for. If a handler is found, the execution chain
associated with the handler (pre-processors, post-processors, controllers) will be
executed in order to prepare a model.
. If a model is returned, the view is rendered, using the view resolver that has been
configured with the `WebApplicationContext`. If no model is returned (which could be due
to a pre- or post-processor intercepting the request, for example, for security
reasons), no view is rendered, since the request could already have been fulfilled.

Exceptions that are thrown during processing of the request get picked up by any of the
handler exception resolvers that are declared in the `WebApplicationContext`. Using
these exception resolvers you can define custom behavior in case such exceptions get
thrown.

You can customize Spring's `DispatcherPortlet` by adding context parameters in the
`portlet.xml` file or portlet init-parameters. The possibilities are listed below.

| Parameter| Explanation

| `contextClass`
| Class that implements `WebApplicationContext`, which will be used to instantiate the
  context used by this portlet. If this parameter isn't specified, the
  `XmlPortletApplicationContext` will be used.

| `contextConfigLocation`
| String which is passed to the context instance (specified by `contextClass`) to
  indicate where context(s) can be found. The String is potentially split up into
  multiple Strings (using a comma as a delimiter) to support multiple contexts (in case
  of multiple context locations, for beans that are defined twice, the latest takes
  precedence).

| `namespace`
| The namespace of the `WebApplicationContext`. Defaults to `[portlet-name]-portlet`.

| `viewRendererUrl`
| The URL at which `DispatcherPortlet` can access an instance of `ViewRendererServlet`
  (see <<portlet-viewservlet>>).
