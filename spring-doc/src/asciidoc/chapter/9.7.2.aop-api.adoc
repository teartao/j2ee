[[aop-api-autoproxy-abstract]]
===== AbstractAdvisorAutoProxyCreator
This is the superclass of DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator. You can create your own
auto-proxy creators by subclassing this class, in the unlikely event that advisor
definitions offer insufficient customization to the behavior of the framework
`DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator`.



[[aop-autoproxy-metadata]]
==== Using metadata-driven auto-proxying
A particularly important type of auto-proxying is driven by metadata. This produces a
similar programming model to .NET `ServicedComponents`. Instead of defining metadata in
XML descriptors, configuration for transaction management and other enterprise services
is held in source-level attributes.

In this case, you use the `DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator`, in combination with Advisors
that understand metadata attributes. The metadata specifics are held in the pointcut
part of the candidate advisors, rather than in the auto-proxy creation class itself.

This is really a special case of the `DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator`, but deserves
consideration on its own. (The metadata-aware code is in the pointcuts contained in the
advisors, not the AOP framework itself.)

The `/attributes` directory of the JPetStore sample application shows the use of
attribute-driven auto-proxying. In this case, there's no need to use the
`TransactionProxyFactoryBean`. Simply defining transactional attributes on business
objects is sufficient, because of the use of metadata-aware pointcuts. The bean
definitions include the following code, in `/WEB-INF/declarativeServices.xml`. Note that
this is generic, and can be used outside the JPetStore:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean class="org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator"/>

	<bean class="org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionAttributeSourceAdvisor">
		<property name="transactionInterceptor" ref="transactionInterceptor"/>
	</bean>

	<bean id="transactionInterceptor"
			class="org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionInterceptor">
		<property name="transactionManager" ref="transactionManager"/>
		<property name="transactionAttributeSource">
			<bean class="org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.AttributesTransactionAttributeSource">
				<property name="attributes" ref="attributes"/>
			</bean>
		</property>
	</bean>

	<bean id="attributes" class="org.springframework.metadata.commons.CommonsAttributes"/>
----

The `DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator` bean definition (the name is not significant, hence
it can even be omitted) will pick up all eligible pointcuts in the current application
context. In this case, the "transactionAdvisor" bean definition, of type
`TransactionAttributeSourceAdvisor`, will apply to classes or methods carrying a
transaction attribute. The TransactionAttributeSourceAdvisor depends on a
TransactionInterceptor, via constructor dependency. The example resolves this via
autowiring. The `AttributesTransactionAttributeSource` depends on an implementation of
the `org.springframework.metadata.Attributes` interface. In this fragment, the
"attributes" bean satisfies this, using the Jakarta Commons Attributes API to obtain
attribute information. (The application code must have been compiled using the Commons
Attributes compilation task.)

The `/annotation` directory of the JPetStore sample application contains an analogous
example for auto-proxying driven by JDK 1.5+ annotations. The following configuration
enables automatic detection of Spring's `Transactional` annotation, leading to implicit
proxies for beans containing that annotation:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean class="org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator"/>

	<bean class="org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionAttributeSourceAdvisor">
		<property name="transactionInterceptor" ref="transactionInterceptor"/>
	</bean>

	<bean id="transactionInterceptor"
			class="org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionInterceptor">
		<property name="transactionManager" ref="transactionManager"/>
		<property name="transactionAttributeSource">
			<bean class="org.springframework.transaction.annotation.AnnotationTransactionAttributeSource"/>
		</property>
	</bean>
----

The `TransactionInterceptor` defined here depends on a `PlatformTransactionManager`
definition, which is not included in this generic file (although it could be) because it
will be specific to the application's transaction requirements (typically JTA, as in
this example, or Hibernate, JDO or JDBC):

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="transactionManager"
			class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager"/>
----

[TIP]
====

If you require only declarative transaction management, using these generic XML
definitions will result in Spring automatically proxying all classes or methods with
transaction attributes. You won't need to work directly with AOP, and the programming
model is similar to that of .NET ServicedComponents.
====

This mechanism is extensible. It's possible to do auto-proxying based on custom
attributes. You need to:

* Define your custom attribute.
* Specify an Advisor with the necessary advice, including a pointcut that is triggered
  by the presence of the custom attribute on a class or method. You may be able to use
  an existing advice, merely implementing a static pointcut that picks up the custom
  attribute.

It's possible for such advisors to be unique to each advised class (for example, mixins):
they simply need to be defined as prototype, rather than singleton, bean definitions.
For example, the `LockMixin` introduction interceptor from the Spring test suite,
shown above, could be used in conjunction with a generic `DefaultIntroductionAdvisor`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="lockMixin" class="test.mixin.LockMixin" scope="prototype"/>

	<bean id="lockableAdvisor" class="org.springframework.aop.support.DefaultIntroductionAdvisor"
			scope="prototype">
		<constructor-arg ref="lockMixin"/>
	</bean>
----

Note that both `lockMixin` and `lockableAdvisor` are defined as prototypes.
