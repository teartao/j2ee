[[aop-api-pointcut-ops]]
==== Operations on pointcuts
Spring supports operations on pointcuts: notably, __union__ and __intersection__.

* Union means the methods that either pointcut matches.
* Intersection means the methods that both pointcuts match.
* Union is usually more useful.
* Pointcuts can be composed using the static methods in the
  __org.springframework.aop.support.Pointcuts__ class, or using the
  __ComposablePointcut__ class in the same package. However, using AspectJ pointcut
  expressions is usually a simpler approach.



[[aop-api-pointcuts-aspectj]]
==== AspectJ expression pointcuts
Since 2.0, the most important type of pointcut used by Spring is
`org.springframework.aop.aspectj.AspectJExpressionPointcut`. This is a pointcut that
uses an AspectJ supplied library to parse an AspectJ pointcut expression string.

See the previous chapter for a discussion of supported AspectJ pointcut primitives.



[[aop-api-pointcuts-impls]]
==== Convenience pointcut implementations
Spring provides several convenient pointcut implementations. Some can be used out of the
box; others are intended to be subclassed in application-specific pointcuts.


[[aop-api-pointcuts-static]]
===== Static pointcuts
Static pointcuts are based on method and target class, and cannot take into account the
method's arguments. Static pointcuts are sufficient - __and best__ - for most usages.
It's possible for Spring to evaluate a static pointcut only once, when a method is first
invoked: after that, there is no need to evaluate the pointcut again with each method
invocation.

Let's consider some static pointcut implementations included with Spring.

[[aop-api-pointcuts-regex]]
====== Regular expression pointcuts
One obvious way to specify static pointcuts is regular expressions. Several AOP
frameworks besides Spring make this possible.
`org.springframework.aop.support.JdkRegexpMethodPointcut` is a generic regular
expression pointcut, using the regular expression support in JDK 1.4+.

Using the `JdkRegexpMethodPointcut` class, you can provide a list of pattern Strings. If
any of these is a match, the pointcut will evaluate to true. (So the result is
effectively the union of these pointcuts.)

The usage is shown below:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
	<bean id="settersAndAbsquatulatePointcut"
			class="org.springframework.aop.support.JdkRegexpMethodPointcut">
		<property name="patterns">
			<list>
				<value>.*set.*</value>
				<value>.*absquatulate</value>
			</list>
		</property>
	</bean>
----

Spring provides a convenience class, `RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor`, that allows us to
also reference an Advice (remember that an Advice can be an interceptor, before advice,
throws advice etc.). Behind the scenes, Spring will use a `JdkRegexpMethodPointcut`.
Using `RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor` simplifies wiring, as the one bean encapsulates both
pointcut and advice, as shown below:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
	<bean id="settersAndAbsquatulateAdvisor"
			class="org.springframework.aop.support.RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor">
		<property name="advice">
			<ref bean="beanNameOfAopAllianceInterceptor"/>
		</property>
		<property name="patterns">
			<list>
				<value>.*set.*</value>
				<value>.*absquatulate</value>
			</list>
		</property>
	</bean>
----

__RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor__ can be used with any Advice type.

[[aop-api-pointcuts-attribute-driven]]
====== Attribute-driven pointcuts
An important type of static pointcut is a __metadata-driven__ pointcut. This uses the
values of metadata attributes: typically, source-level metadata.


[[aop-api-pointcuts-dynamic]]
===== Dynamic pointcuts
Dynamic pointcuts are costlier to evaluate than static pointcuts. They take into account
method __arguments__, as well as static information. This means that they must be
evaluated with every method invocation; the result cannot be cached, as arguments will
vary.

The main example is the `control flow` pointcut.

[[aop-api-pointcuts-cflow]]
====== Control flow pointcuts
Spring control flow pointcuts are conceptually similar to AspectJ __cflow__ pointcuts,
although less powerful. (There is currently no way to specify that a pointcut executes
below a join point matched by another pointcut.) A control flow pointcut matches the
current call stack. For example, it might fire if the join point was invoked by a method
in the `com.mycompany.web` package, or by the `SomeCaller` class. Control flow pointcuts
are specified using the `org.springframework.aop.support.ControlFlowPointcut` class.
[NOTE]
====
Control flow pointcuts are significantly more expensive to evaluate at runtime than even
other dynamic pointcuts. In Java 1.4, the cost is about 5 times that of other dynamic
pointcuts.
====



[[aop-api-pointcuts-superclasses]]
==== Pointcut superclasses
Spring provides useful pointcut superclasses to help you to implement your own pointcuts.

Because static pointcuts are most useful, you'll probably subclass
StaticMethodMatcherPointcut, as shown below. This requires implementing just one
abstract method (although it's possible to override other methods to customize behavior):

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	class TestStaticPointcut extends StaticMethodMatcherPointcut {

		public boolean matches(Method m, Class targetClass) {
			// return true if custom criteria match
		}
	}
----

There are also superclasses for dynamic pointcuts.

You can use custom pointcuts with any advice type in Spring 1.0 RC2 and above.



[[aop-api-pointcuts-custom]]
==== Custom pointcuts
Because pointcuts in Spring AOP are Java classes, rather than language features (as in
AspectJ) it's possible to declare custom pointcuts, whether static or dynamic. Custom
pointcuts in Spring can be arbitrarily complex. However, using the AspectJ pointcut
expression language is recommended if possible.

[NOTE]
====
Later versions of Spring may offer support for "semantic pointcuts" as offered by JAC:
for example, "all methods that change instance variables in the target object."
