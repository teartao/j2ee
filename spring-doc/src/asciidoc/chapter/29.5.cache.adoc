[[cache-spel-context]]
===== Available caching SpEL evaluation context

Each `SpEL` expression evaluates again a dedicated
<<expressions-language-ref,`context`>>. In addition to the build in parameters, the
framework provides dedicated caching related metadata such as the argument names. The
next table lists the items made available to the context so one can use them for key and
conditional computations:

|===
| Name| Location| Description| Example

| methodName
| root object
| The name of the method being invoked
| `#root.methodName`

| method
| root object
| The method being invoked
| `#root.method.name`

| target
| root object
| The target object being invoked
| `#root.target`

| targetClass
| root object
| The class of the target being invoked
| `#root.targetClass`

| args
| root object
| The arguments (as array) used for invoking the target
| `#root.args[0]`

| caches
| root object
| Collection of caches against which the current method is executed
| `#root.caches[0].name`

| __argument name__
| evaluation context
| Name of any of the method argument. If for some reason the names are not available
  (ex: no debug information), the argument names are also available under the `a<#arg>`
  where __#arg__ stands for the argument index (starting from 0).
| `iban` or `a0` (one can also use `p0` or `p<#arg>` notation as an alias).

| result
| evaluation context
| The result of the method call (the value to be cached). Only available in `unless`
  expressions, `cache put` expressions (to compute the `key`), or `cache evict`
  expressions (when `beforeInvocation` is `false`).
| `#result`
