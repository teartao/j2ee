==== The Controller ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping

The `ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping` class is a `HandlerMapping` implementation that
uses a convention to determine the mapping between request URLs and the `Controller`
instances that are to handle those requests.

Consider the following simple `Controller` implementation. Take special notice of the
__name__ of the class.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class **ViewShoppingCartController** implements Controller {

		public ModelAndView handleRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
			// the implementation is not hugely important for this example...
		}

	}
----

Here is a snippet from the corresponding Spring Web MVC configuration file:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.support.ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping"/>

	<bean id="**viewShoppingCart**" class="x.y.z.ViewShoppingCartController">
		<!-- inject dependencies as required... -->
	</bean>
----

The `ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping` finds all of the various handler (or
`Controller`) beans defined in its application context and strips `Controller` off the
name to define its handler mappings. Thus, `ViewShoppingCartController` maps to the
`/viewshoppingcart*` request URL.

Let's look at some more examples so that the central idea becomes immediately familiar.
(Notice all lowercase in the URLs, in contrast to camel-cased `Controller` class names.)

* `WelcomeController` maps to the `/welcome*` request URL
* `HomeController` maps to the `/home*` request URL
* `IndexController` maps to the `/index*` request URL
* `RegisterController` maps to the `/register*` request URL

In the case of `MultiActionController` handler classes, the mappings generated are
slightly more complex. The `Controller` names in the following examples are assumed to
be `MultiActionController` implementations:

* `AdminController` maps to the `/admin/*` request URL
* `CatalogController` maps to the `/catalog/*` request URL

If you follow the convention of naming your `Controller` implementations as
`xxxController`, the `ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping` saves you the tedium of
defining and maintaining a potentially __looooong__ `SimpleUrlHandlerMapping` (or
suchlike).

The `ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping` class extends the `AbstractHandlerMapping` base
class so you can define `HandlerInterceptor` instances and everything else just as you
would with many other `HandlerMapping` implementations.
