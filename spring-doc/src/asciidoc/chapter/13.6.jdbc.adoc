[[jdbc-SQLExceptionTranslator]]
==== SQLExceptionTranslator

`SQLExceptionTranslator` is an interface to be implemented by classes that can translate
between `SQLExceptions` and Spring's own `org.springframework.dao.DataAccessException`,
which is agnostic in regard to data access strategy. Implementations can be generic (for
example, using SQLState codes for JDBC) or proprietary (for example, using Oracle error
codes) for greater precision.

`SQLErrorCodeSQLExceptionTranslator` is the implementation of `SQLExceptionTranslator`
that is used by default. This implementation uses specific vendor codes. It is more
precise than the `SQLState` implementation. The error code translations are based on
codes held in a JavaBean type class called `SQLErrorCodes`. This class is created and
populated by an `SQLErrorCodesFactory` which as the name suggests is a factory for
creating `SQLErrorCodes` based on the contents of a configuration file named
`sql-error-codes.xml`. This file is populated with vendor codes and based on the
`DatabaseProductName` taken from the `DatabaseMetaData`. The codes for the actual
database you are using are used.

The `SQLErrorCodeSQLExceptionTranslator` applies matching rules in the following sequence:

[NOTE]
====
The `SQLErrorCodesFactory` is used by default to define Error codes and custom exception
translations. They are looked up in a file named `sql-error-codes.xml` from the
classpath and the matching `SQLErrorCodes` instance is located based on the database
name from the database metadata of the database in use.
====
* Any custom translation implemented by a subclass. Normally the provided concrete
  `SQLErrorCodeSQLExceptionTranslator` is used so this rule does not apply. It only
  applies if you have actually provided a subclass implementation.
* Any custom implementation of the `SQLExceptionTranslator` interface that is provided
  as the `customSqlExceptionTranslator` property of the `SQLErrorCodes` class.
* The list of instances of the `CustomSQLErrorCodesTranslation` class, provided for the
  `customTranslations` property of the `SQLErrorCodes` class, are searched for a match.
* Error code matching is applied.
* Use the fallback translator. `SQLExceptionSubclassTranslator` is the default fallback
  translator. If this translation is not available then the next fallback translator is
  the `SQLStateSQLExceptionTranslator`.

You can extend `SQLErrorCodeSQLExceptionTranslator:`

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class CustomSQLErrorCodesTranslator extends SQLErrorCodeSQLExceptionTranslator {

		protected DataAccessException customTranslate(String task, String sql, SQLException sqlex) {
			if (sqlex.getErrorCode() == -12345) {
				return new DeadlockLoserDataAccessException(task, sqlex);
			}
			return null;
		}
	}
----

In this example, the specific error code `-12345` is translated and other errors are
left to be translated by the default translator implementation. To use this custom
translator, it is necessary to pass it to the `JdbcTemplate` through the method
`setExceptionTranslator` and to use this `JdbcTemplate` for all of the data access
processing where this translator is needed. Here is an example of how this custom
translator can be used:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

	public void setDataSource(DataSource dataSource) {

		// create a JdbcTemplate and set data source
		this.jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate();
		this.jdbcTemplate.setDataSource(dataSource);

		// create a custom translator and set the DataSource for the default translation lookup
		CustomSQLErrorCodesTranslator tr = new CustomSQLErrorCodesTranslator();
		tr.setDataSource(dataSource);
		this.jdbcTemplate.setExceptionTranslator(tr);

	}

	public void updateShippingCharge(long orderId, long pct) {
		// use the prepared JdbcTemplate for this update
		this.jdbcTemplate.update("update orders" +
			" set shipping_charge = shipping_charge * ? / 100" +
			" where id = ?", pct, orderId);
	}
----

The custom translator is passed a data source in order to look up the error codes in
`sql-error-codes.xml`.
