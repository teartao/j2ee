==== Retrieving auto-generated keys
An `update()` convenience method supports the retrieval of primary keys generated by the
database. This support is part of the JDBC 3.0 standard; see Chapter 13.6 of the
specification for details. The method takes a `PreparedStatementCreator` as its first
argument, and this is the way the required insert statement is specified. The other
argument is a `KeyHolder`, which contains the generated key on successful return from
the update. There is not a standard single way to create an appropriate
`PreparedStatement` (which explains why the method signature is the way it is). The
following example works on Oracle but may not work on other platforms:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	final String INSERT_SQL = "insert into my_test (name) values(?)";
	final String name = "Rob";

	KeyHolder keyHolder = new GeneratedKeyHolder();
	jdbcTemplate.update(
		new PreparedStatementCreator() {
			public PreparedStatement createPreparedStatement(Connection connection) throws SQLException {
				PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(INSERT_SQL, new String[] {"id"});
				ps.setString(1, name);
				return ps;
			}
		},
		keyHolder);

	// keyHolder.getKey() now contains the generated key
