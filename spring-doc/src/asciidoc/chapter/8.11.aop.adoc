=== Mixing aspect types
It is perfectly possible to mix @AspectJ style aspects using the autoproxying support,
schema-defined `<aop:aspect>` aspects, `<aop:advisor>` declared advisors and even
proxies and interceptors defined using the Spring 1.2 style in the same configuration.
All of these are implemented using the same underlying support mechanism and will
co-exist without any difficulty.




[[aop-proxying]]
=== Proxying mechanisms
Spring AOP uses either JDK dynamic proxies or CGLIB to create the proxy for a given
target object. (JDK dynamic proxies are preferred whenever you have a choice).

If the target object to be proxied implements at least one interface then a JDK dynamic
proxy will be used. All of the interfaces implemented by the target type will be
proxied. If the target object does not implement any interfaces then a CGLIB proxy will
be created.

If you want to force the use of CGLIB proxying (for example, to proxy every method
defined for the target object, not just those implemented by its interfaces) you can do
so. However, there are some issues to consider:

* `final` methods cannot be advised, as they cannot be overridden.
* As of Spring 3.2, it is no longer necessary to add CGLIB to your project classpath, as
  CGLIB classes are repackaged under org.springframework and included directly in the
  spring-core JAR. This means that CGLIB-based proxy support 'just works' in the same
  way that JDK dynamic proxies always have.
* The constructor of your proxied object will be called twice. This is a natural
  consequence of the CGLIB proxy model whereby a subclass is generated for each proxied
  object. For each proxied instance, two objects are created: the actual proxied object
  and an instance of the subclass that implements the advice. This behavior is not
  exhibited when using JDK proxies. Usually, calling the constructor of the proxied type
  twice, is not an issue, as there are usually only assignments taking place and no real
  logic is implemented in the constructor.

To force the use of CGLIB proxies set the value of the `proxy-target-class` attribute of
the `<aop:config>` element to true:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<aop:config proxy-target-class="true">
		<!-- other beans defined here... -->
	</aop:config>
----

To force CGLIB proxying when using the @AspectJ autoproxy support, set the
`'proxy-target-class'` attribute of the `<aop:aspectj-autoproxy>` element to `true`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<aop:aspectj-autoproxy proxy-target-class="true"/>
----

[NOTE]
====
Multiple `<aop:config/>` sections are collapsed into a single unified auto-proxy creator
at runtime, which applies the __strongest__ proxy settings that any of the
`<aop:config/>` sections (typically from different XML bean definition files) specified.
This also applies to the `<tx:annotation-driven/>` and `<aop:aspectj-autoproxy/>`
elements.

To be clear: using '++proxy-target-class="true"++' on `<tx:annotation-driven/>`,
`<aop:aspectj-autoproxy/>` or `<aop:config/>` elements will force the use of CGLIB
proxies __for all three of them__.

[[aop-understanding-aop-proxies]]
==== Understanding AOP proxies
Spring AOP is __proxy-based__. It is vitally important that you grasp the semantics of
what that last statement actually means before you write your own aspects or use any of
the Spring AOP-based aspects supplied with the Spring Framework.

Consider first the scenario where you have a plain-vanilla, un-proxied,
nothing-special-about-it, straight object reference, as illustrated by the following
code snippet.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class SimplePojo implements Pojo {

		public void foo() {
			// this next method invocation is a direct call on the 'this' reference
			this.bar();
		}

		public void bar() {
			// some logic...
		}
	}
----

If you invoke a method on an object reference, the method is invoked __directly__ on
that object reference, as can be seen below.

image::images/aop-proxy-plain-pojo-call.png[width=400]

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class Main {

		public static void main(String[] args) {

			Pojo pojo = new SimplePojo();

			// this is a direct method call on the 'pojo' reference
			pojo.foo();
		}
	}
----

Things change slightly when the reference that client code has is a proxy. Consider the
following diagram and code snippet.

image::images/aop-proxy-call.png[width=400]

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class Main {

		public static void main(String[] args) {

			ProxyFactory factory = new ProxyFactory(new SimplePojo());
			factory.addInterface(Pojo.class);
			factory.addAdvice(new RetryAdvice());

			Pojo pojo = (Pojo) factory.getProxy();

			// this is a method call on the proxy!
			pojo.foo();
		}
	}
----

The key thing to understand here is that the client code inside the `main(..)` of the
`Main` class __has a reference to the proxy__. This means that method calls on that
object reference will be calls on the proxy, and as such the proxy will be able to
delegate to all of the interceptors (advice) that are relevant to that particular method
call. However, once the call has finally reached the target object, the `SimplePojo`
reference in this case, any method calls that it may make on itself, such as
`this.bar()` or `this.foo()`, are going to be invoked against the __this__ reference,
and __not__ the proxy. This has important implications. It means that self-invocation is
__not__ going to result in the advice associated with a method invocation getting a
chance to execute.

Okay, so what is to be done about this? The best approach (the term best is used loosely
here) is to refactor your code such that the self-invocation does not happen. For sure,
this does entail some work on your part, but it is the best, least-invasive approach.
The next approach is absolutely horrendous, and I am almost reticent to point it out
precisely because it is so horrendous. You can (choke!) totally tie the logic within
your class to Spring AOP by doing this:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class SimplePojo implements Pojo {

		public void foo() {
			// this works, but... gah!
			((Pojo) AopContext.currentProxy()).bar();
		}

		public void bar() {
			// some logic...
		}
	}
----

This totally couples your code to Spring AOP, __and__ it makes the class itself aware of
the fact that it is being used in an AOP context, which flies in the face of AOP. It
also requires some additional configuration when the proxy is being created:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class Main {

		public static void main(String[] args) {

			ProxyFactory factory = new ProxyFactory(new SimplePojo());
			factory.adddInterface(Pojo.class);
			factory.addAdvice(new RetryAdvice());
			factory.setExposeProxy(true);

			Pojo pojo = (Pojo) factory.getProxy();

			// this is a method call on the proxy!
			pojo.foo();
		}
	}
----

Finally, it must be noted that AspectJ does not have this self-invocation issue because
it is not a proxy-based AOP framework.
